<!--
**sewoo10/sewoo10** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a second bachelor's in Computer Science at OSU
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Software Engineering and Operating Systems
- âš¡ Fun fact: I run a restaurant/taproom full-time while going to school part-time
